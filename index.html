<p align="center"><i>What did we do for nearly 250,000 years? We huddled in caves and around small fires, fearful of the things that we didn't understand. We called them 'gods' and 'demons', begged them to spare us, and prayed for salvation.</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>In time, their numbers dwindled and ours rose. The world began to make more sense when there were fewer things to fear, yet the unexplained can never truly go away.</i></p>
<p align="center"><i>Mankind must not go back to hiding in fear. No one else will protect us, and we must stand up for ourselves.</i></p>
<p align="center"><b><i>Secure. Contain. Protect.</i></b></p>

<p align="center">Skippy.aic is the highest-compatibility SCP Wiki scraper Discord bot that allows users to display SCP articles in easily readable embeds, along with other useful and fun features.</p>
<p align="center"><font size="+2"><a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=837940465286250506&amp;permissions=536873024&amp;scope=bot">[Add Skippy.aic to Discord!]</a></font></p>

<h1 id="featurescommands" align="center"><font size="+1">Features/Commands</font></h1>
</br>
<p><strong>Open Source:</strong> If you have concerns with the bots you add to your servers, you can rest easy knowing that Skippy.aic’s code is completely free to view in order to ensure privacy (no matter how poo poo the code is). If you want, you can even download all the files and host your own version of the bot. Check out Skippy.aic’s GitHub!</p>

<p><strong>SCP Embeds:</strong> Just by typing ./scp and a number, Skippy.aic can retrieve all the SCP’s information, including the Description, Object Class, Disruption Class, and Risk Class at a moment’s notice.</p>

<p><strong>Article Refinement:</strong> Skippy.aic allows for JSON file overrides, which means that bugged article embeds can be fixed easily and great articles can look even better in Discord embeds.</p>

<p><strong>Webhook Enhancement:</strong> Using the Foundation’s finest interdimensional travel technology and thaumaturgy, Skippy.aic can dynamically change it’s own name and profile picture to match the other-worldly embed content perfectly using secure and immediately-disposed-of webhooks.</p>

<p><strong>Auto-Embeds:</strong> Skippy.aic can automatically detect compatible SCP Wiki URLs and respond with that article’s embed. If you share an article with friends, Skippy.aic can help to ensure the article is readable for everyone without having to click off of Discord.<br>
<em>Privacy Note: The Auto-Embed feature is optional. It’s code is completely open-source, free to read, and does not store detected messages. This feature can be disabled by going to the bot’s “Skippy.aic” role and removing the “Add Reactions” permission. This will cause the Auto-Embed function to immediately cancel and not view, reply to, or attempt to process any messages.</em></p>

<p><strong>Highest-Compatibility:</strong> Skippy.aic supports a vast majority of typical formats used by SCP Wiki authors, including the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/anomaly-classification-system-guide">Anomaly Classification System</a>, the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:flops-header">Flops Disruption Class header</a>, the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:classified-bar-woed">Woed Classified Bar</a>, and, of course, the default Object Class system.</p>
